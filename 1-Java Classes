- Class: A named group of properties & functions.

- If i want to combine the below data of a Student into a single entity, i can do it only via class.

    Eg.: data of 5 students : {roll no, name, marks}
          int [] rno = new int[5] ;
          String[] name = new String [5] ;
          float [] marks = new float [5];

- Creating class is also can be considered as creating your own data type, as you create you student class which contains above variables/data inside it.

    Example:
            class Student {
                     int [] rno = new int[5] ;
                     String[] name = new String [5] ;
                     float [] marks = new float [5];
            }
