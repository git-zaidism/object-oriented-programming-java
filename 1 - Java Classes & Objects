-------------------------------------------------Classes-------------------------------------------------

- Class: A named group of properties & functions.

- If i want to combine the below data of a Student into a single entity, i can do it only via class.

    Eg.: data of 5 students : {roll no, name, marks}
          int [] rno = new int[5] ;
          String[] name = new String [5] ;
          float [] marks = new float [5];

- Creating class is also can be considered as creating your own data type, as you create you student class which contains above variables/data inside it.

    Example:
            class Student {
                     int rno;
                     String name ;
                     float marks;
            }
            
-------------------------------------------------Objects-------------------------------------------------

- An object is an instace of a class. 
    
    Example: A Human in real life can be considered as class. It has some by default properties like two eyes, two legs, two hands, one nose etc etc.
    Every human we see in daily life are diffrent from each other in terms of color, height, looks, weight etc. These diffrent kind of humans are nothing 
    but the instance/object of the class Human.
    
    When humans are born they are instance of human class & Human class is a set of rule create by god.

- class : Logical Construct
- object : A physical reality (occupies the space in the memory)

- Objects are stored in the heap memory & refernce varibles are stored in the stack memory.
- By default values of an object of a class is null. 

    Student student; // at this point student value is null 


- new keyword used to create an object, while creating an object new keyword dynamically allocates the memory & return the reference to it.

    Eg: Student student = new Student();

* Dynamic Memory Allocation
    
    Student student = new Student();

In above example all the things 
    - written at LHS happens at Compile time
    - written at RHS happens at Run time

   
   class Student {
                     int rno;
                     String name;
                     float marks;
            }
   Student student = new Student();
   
   System.out.println(student); // some random locationor address
   System.out.println(student.rno); // defualt value of primitive will be 0
   System.out.println(student.name); // defualt value of String which is class will be null
   System.out.println(student.marks); // defualt value of primitive will be 0.0
